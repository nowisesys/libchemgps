Some function don't work on Linux version of Simca-QP:

* int SQX_GetVersionNumber(char **):

      Declared in header SQXCInterface.h, but is not defined in the Simca-Q
      library. Use objdump -TC /usr/local/lib/libsimca.so to examine the
      dynamic symbol table.

* int SQX_GetLoggingStatus(int *):
* int SQX_SetLoggingStatus(int):

      Both these function makes the application hang waiting for another
      thread to wake up process sleeping on futex(2) call (a bug?)
