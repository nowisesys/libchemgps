*** ABOUT LIBCHEMGPS ***

** GENERAL:

   The libchemgps library is a generic library for making predictions using
   SIMCA-QP. Use this library to write standalone and client/server
   applications for SIMCA-QP. The chemgps-sqp2 package contains both a fully
   functional standalone application as well as an client/server solution.
   
   You need a separate license from Umetrics (http://www.umetrics.com) for 
   using this library.

** BUILD:

   Configure and build with (64-bit Linux):
   
     bash$> CC="gcc32" CFLAGS="-Wall -O -g -m32" ./configure
     bash$> make

   See docs/README.compiler for build notes.
   
** USAGE:

   See the manual page and the chemgps-sqp2 package for example code.
   
   In short, define callbacks and initilize an cgps_options structure.
   Call cgps_project_load() to load the project. 
   
   For each prediction call cgps_predict_init() and cgps_predict() to 
   make the prediction. 
   
   Get the result of prediction using cgps_result_init() and cgps_result(). 
   
   Cleanup and after each prediction by calling cgps_predict_cleanup() and
   cgps_result_cleanup().
   
   Unload the project by calling cgps_project_close().
